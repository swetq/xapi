These are some of the things I plan to look at:

* FIX BUGS! (fixing bugs is always a priority)
* Unit testing
* Investigate if find and dir /S is faster than current search
* Read a process output line by line and not all at once, since processes with big outputs might crash.
* API addition: xa.Folder.copyAsync(), xa.File.copyAsyc(), xa.Search.searchAsync(). Some file system operations can be lengthy so it might be handy keeping a responsive application. Ideally, there will be some kind of callback with information about the state of the process (think "copied 12/456" kind of thing).
